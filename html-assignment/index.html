    <p> My name is Ramanpreet kaur . i hailed from <strong>Amritsar,India</strong>. I recently completed my senior secondary education from backhome . After that,On 20 <sup>th</sup> April I landed to Canada for pursuing further education in the program Interactive media design at <abbr title="Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology is a publicly funded English-language college located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada">Algonquin College</abbr>.

        <li>Swimming</li>

    </ul>
    <p>I like to recieve and deal with challenging tasks. I am very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point for me. My friends say that i am very funnny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor.As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me,I feel extremely comfortable with them . Moreover, I am reliable but very short-tempered. I lose my calm if not understood properly.However,I would like to change this character trait a little because my friends and loved ones often do not noticevthat i have some troubles. Thus, they do not offer help when i need it. Good or bad, this is me ,trying to contrmplate the world as it is, revealing its true colors. I believe life is a gift, and it should be treated like one, with love,care,and respect.</p>
